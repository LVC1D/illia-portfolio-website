# The portfolio site

## Overview

The aim of this project is to create the foundational product that would serve as my portfolio website.
As I progress learning more languages, skills and toolsets in the **Full Stack Development Career Path** provided by *Codecademy*, more stuff will be added in incrementally.
With this project, the following has been achieved:

1. Applied the semantic HTML structure on the main,and the Form pages
2. Used multiple CSS strategies, such as colors, font pairs and flexbox to achieve a simple yet most streamlined experience viewing the webpages
3. Applied responsive techniques, such as relative font size measurements, `@media` queries to adjust the contents depending on the critical breakpoints
4. Used JavaScript to add some basic interactivity, in this case - providing extra content added as you interact with certian elements (more on that below)

### Requirements

In order to run this website yourself, you need to have a text editor, such as VS Code to be able to access all the relevant files by Git-Cloning this project.
To clone it 

- go to your Terminal on Mac (or Command Prompt on Windows)
- make sure you `cd` to the directory in which you want to clone the project
- use `git clone` + the SSH URL of the project available in ths repository

And that's it! If you want to leave any remarks, feel free to do so leaving a comment in it ðŸ˜¸
Have fun, and if you're also a code, good luck on your techy endeavours ðŸ’»ðŸ¤“
